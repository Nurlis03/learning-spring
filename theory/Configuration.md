Spring Core Configuration is the process of configuring the Spring Framework, which involves specifying the various configuration details required for an application to function properly. This can include setting up beans, specifying bean dependencies, configuring aspect-oriented programming (AOP) aspects, and more. Configuration can be done through Java code, XML files, or using annotations in the code.
